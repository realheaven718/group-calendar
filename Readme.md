BRAINSTORM

tagged with hacktoberfest
100devs classes and events are registered and displayed

MVP
- Anyone can visit site
- We add events or users personally request us for accounts to add events
- Events can be clickable for more info


Next level 

- users authenticate with discord oauth2 
- oauth will check to see if they are in the 100devs guild(server)
- users can add or delete events (two step delete process for confirmation)
- (can have an event log tied to user name)

Next next level stuff
- users rsvp events and a total is displayed
- events can have channels tagged that match the server channel emojis daily view. clicking on the day can bring up a day planner view just like google calendar
- users can add event to their calendar through a click
- users can share events to twitter
- new event notification dots(easy mode might be to just highlight new events on each reload)

thinking ahead
keep these in mind to prevent the project from being "caged"
can integrate with slack or discord and work on other servers besides 100devs
