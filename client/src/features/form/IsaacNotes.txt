MY TODO:
- Figure out how our date/time system workfa-spin
- Test if adding 90 days to current date spits out the correct 3 months from now date
- Make if statement and test if setting start or final date past this threshold triggers this boolean
- Change a useState value doing this
- Create an error message that appears if that useState value is changed
- Make sure it's changed back when the dates are actually within range.
- Figure out how to do this in harmony with the person working on the other softSecurity Issues 

Isaac's ideas for 

Things to fix:
- Days of week checkboxes should be disabled if "Weekly" is not selected
- "Add" button on each date should pass the start date and end date directly into the form
- Can scroll the form horizontally - is it's container wider than the window?
- Need time/date validation to ensure end-date-time is not BEFORE start-date-time
- Move Date/Time fields to be next to each other, maybe?
- New event added should appear on the calendar once we're on the success screen without refreshing?
- Recurring events aren't working yet (I think there's already an issue on this)
- In production, can scroll away when viewing event details, "shade" layer looks disconnected, need to lock screen
- Make past days greyed out a little
- Highlight "today" with green or something idk
- Events should be sorted by chronological order 

Features to Add:
- Functional "monthly" recurrence button
- Add a "New Event" button in the top right maybe that just brings you to an empty form
